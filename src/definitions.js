export const variableDefinition = `
In code, we need to be able to keep
track of data (text, numbers, true/false)

And to do that, we use variables.

A variable is like a tracker.

You tell it what data to watch,
and it keeps track of it for you.


#### How do you use it?
1. First, give the variable a name, so you remember what it's tracking.
2. Next, tell the variable what type of data it's tracking.
3. Then, show the variable the data it has to watch.

export const variableNameDefinition = `
Helpful tips for writing a great variable name.

#### Naming Tips:

1. Use full words and phrases

2. Describes what you're using the variable's value for

3. Use camelCase: the first word is lowercase, 
    and everything that follows is uppercase)

export const primitivesDefinition = `
They're the basic types of values you can have.

#### The 5 common ones are:

- string: any text
- number: any number
- boolean: true/false
- null: missing a value on purpose
- undefined: a missing value wasn't expected

#### How do you know which one to use?
- Pick the type based on the kind of value you need to track

#### When do you use them?
- When you're creating new variables.
`;

export const letDefinition = `
**'let'** tells your code when you're creating a new variable.

#### When do you use it?
- Before creating a new variable name

#### When should you use it?
- If the value of the variable changes, use 'let'.
`;

export const constDefinition = `
**'const'** tells your code when you're creating a new variable.

#### When do you use it?
- Before creating a new variable name

#### When should I use it?
- If the value of the variable never changes, use 'const'.
