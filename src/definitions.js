export const letDefinition = `
'let' is the word you use when you wanna create a new value.
											
In code we call that value a variable.

To use 'let' put it in front of a new variable name.

---

**Notes**: Anytime you use the word "let," you can update the variable's value if it changes in the future.
`;

export const constDefinition = `
"const" is the word you use when you want to create a new value that will never change.
											
In code, we call this value a variable.

To use "const," put it in front of a new variable name.
`;

export const variablesDefinition = `
When we code, we need to be able to store the value of things.
											
And the way we store value is with something called a variable.

For example, if you wanted to build an app with "likes," you'd have to create a way to save all those "likes."

To do this, we write "let" or "const."

Then write the name of the variable we want to create and give it a starting value.

In the case of "likes," the starting value always equals 0.

---

**Notes**: The variable name can be anything you want. But it should describe what kind of value it holds.
`;

export const primitivesDefinition = `
When you create a new variable, you give it a value.
											
And depending on the value you give it, you turn that variable into a specific type.

**5 Common Types:**
* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
`;

export const arraysDefinition = `
Sometimes you need to create a group of things with the same type.
											
To do that, you use an array.
`;

export const objectsDefinition = `
Sometimes you need to group a lot of values that belong to the same thing.

To do that, you use an object.
`;

export const arithmeticOperatorsDefinition = `
Use this to get the value of two or more numbers.

**5 common types**:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Remainder/Modulo
`;

export const operatorPrecedenceDefinition = `
Tells your code what math to do first.

To do this, put whatever math you need to do first in parenthesis.
`;

export const incrementDecrementDefinition = `
A quick way to add or subtract a number by one.
`;

export const assignmentOperatorsDefinition = `
A quick way to give a variable a new value.

**2 Common Types**:
* Addition: +=
* Subtraction: -=

**Steps**:
1. Write variable name
2. Add += or -=
3. Write the new value you want to add or subtract from the variable.
`;

export const comparisonOperatorsDefinition = `
Use this when you wanna test if something is true or false.

**6 Types**:
* Strict Equality: ===
* Strict Non Equality: !==
* Less than: <
* Greater than: >
* Less than or equal to: <=
* Greater than or equal to: >=
`;

export const ifStatementsDefinition = `
Lets you do things only if something's true.

**To use it, ask**:
* What do you want to happen?
* When do you want it to happen?
`;

export const ifElseStatementsDefinition = `
Lets you do things only if something's true.

And do something else if it's false.

**To use it, ask**:
* What do you want to happen?
* When do you want it to happen?
* What happens if it's false?
`;

export const elseIfStatementsDefinition = `
Use it when an if statement is false but something else is true.

**To use it, ask**:
* What do you want to happen?
* When do you want it to happen?
* What happens if something else's true?

---

**Notes**: An "else if" statement goes between and if and else.
`;

export const logicalAndDefinition = `
Use it when two or more things need to be true for something to happen.

---

**Notes**: Used in if / else parentheses
`;

export const logicalOrDefinition = `
Use it when two or more things can make something happen.

---

**Notes**: Used in if / else parentheses
`;

export const functionDeclarationDefinition = `
What's something you do all the time?

A function takes that one job and breaks it down into little steps.

So that it can repeat those steps and finish the job.

It's kind of like having your own robot.

You tell it what you want, and then it does the job.
`;

export const methodsDefinition = `
When you put a function inside an object, it's called a method.

And even though your method can do anything

It's used to do something with values inside an object.
`;

export const thisDefinition = `
Use "this" whenever you want to get info about an object.

But based on where you use it, you get different results.

For example, when you use "this" inside an object, you get back all the info about that object.
`;

export const classesDefinition = `
A class is a function that creates objects with the same properties and methods.

All you have to do is plan what your object should look like.

Then build it by giving it the right values.
