export const statementDefinition = `
If you want a computer to do something,
you need to give it instructions to follow.

So, for example, if you had to give your car 
some instructions to follow, here's what you might say...

1. Start
2. Go forward
3. Make a left

And it'd follow all your instructions 
until you told it to stop.

So a statement is an instruction that 
you give your code to follow.

And one of the most basic instructions 
you can give is to create a variable.

export const variableDefinition = `
In code, we need to be able to keep
track of data (text, numbers, true/false)

And to do that, we use variables.

A variable is like a tracker.

You tell it what data to watch,
and it keeps track of it for you.


#### How do you use it?
1. First, give the variable a name, so you remember what it's tracking.
2. Next, tell the variable what type of data it's tracking.
3. Then, show the variable the data it has to watch.

export const variableNameDefinition = `
Helpful tips for writing a great variable name.

#### Naming Tips:

1. Use full words and phrases

2. Describes what you're using the variable's value for

3. Use camelCase: the first word is lowercase, 
    and everything that follows is uppercase)

export const primitivesDefinition = `
They're the basic types of values you can have.

#### The 5 common ones are:

- string: any text
- number: any number
- boolean: true/false
- null: missing a value on purpose
- undefined: a missing value wasn't expected

#### How do you know which one to use?
- Pick the type based on the kind of value you need to track

#### When do you use them?
- When you're creating new variables.
`;

export const letDefinition = `
*'let'* tells your code when you're creating a new variable.

#### When do you use it?
- Before creating a new variable name

#### When should you use it?
- If the value of the variable changes, use 'let'.
`;

export const constDefinition = `
*'const'* tells your code when you're creating a new variable.

#### When do you use it?
- Before creating a new variable name

#### When should I use it?
- If the value of the variable never changes, use 'const'.
`;

export const variableDeclarationDefinition = `
It's how you create a new variable and set its value.

You can use it with either the *'let'* or *'const'* keyword before the variable name.

So use this when you need to create a new variable.

export const commentsDefinition = `
It's used for writing notes in your code.

You can also use it to stop lines of code from working while testing.

So use **(//)** before a line of code to write some notes or avoid a line of code from working.
