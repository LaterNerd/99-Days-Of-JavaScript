export const arraysDefinition = `
Sometimes you need to create a group of things with the same type.
											
To do that, you use an array.

export const objectsDefinition = `
Sometimes you need to group a lot of values that belong to the same thing.

To do that, you use an object.

export const methodsDefinition = `
When you put a function inside an object, it's called a method.

And even though your method can do anything

It's used to do something with values inside an object.

export const thisDefinition = `
Use "this" whenever you want to get info about an object.

But based on where you use it, you get different results.

For example, when you use "this" inside an object, you get back all the info about that object.

export const classesDefinition = `
A class is a function that creates objects with the same properties and methods.

All you have to do is plan what your object should look like.

Then build it by giving it the right values.
