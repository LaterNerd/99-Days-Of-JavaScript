export const expressionDefinition = `
I like to think about an expression as
a question that gives you an answer.

The question: *"what's the value?"*


#### For example:

- If you asked: 1 + 1? The code would ask, *"what's the value?"* 
and answer 2
- If you asked: 1 + 3? It would answer 4
- And, if you asked, 1? It would answer 1


The code's job is to answer the question 
*"what's the value?"* and return a single value.

export const assignmentOperatorDefinition = `
It's the equal sign **(=)**

And it's how you set a variable to a value so you can keep track of it.

You can use it when you're first setting the value on a variable or when you need to update it.

So if you see an equal sign **(=)**, a variable's being set to a new value.
`;

export const comparisonOperatorsDefinition = `
It's a way to compare two values.

And see whether something's true or false based on the comparison.

You can use it with a string, number, boolean, or object.

So use this when you need to compare if something's true or false.

#### 6 Types:
* Strict Equality: ===
* Strict Non Equality: !==
* Less than: <
* Greater than: >
* Less than or equal to: <=
* Greater than or equal to: >=

export const arithmeticOperatorsDefinition = `
It's how your code does math.

So you can use all the same rules and symbols.

But you can use more than numbers.

You can use variables too.

So use this to solve problems like the price of something, quantity, or anything math-y.

#### 5 common types:
* Addition: +
* Subtraction: -
* Multiplication: *
* Division: /
* Remainder/Modulo: %

export const logicalAndDefinition = `
It's the double ampersand symbol **(&&)**

And it's used to test if two expressions are true.

If both expressions pass, it'll return true.

Otherwise, it'll return false.

So when you need to test if two values are true, use this.
`;

export const logicalOrDefinition = `
It's the double pipe symbol **(||)**

And it's used to test two expressions.

If either expression is true, it'll return true.

Otherwise, it'll return false.

So when you need to test if any one of two expressions is true, use this.
`;

export const logicalNotDefinition = `
It's the exclamation point **(!)**

And it's used to flip the boolean value of an expression.

So whenever you wanna get the opposite boolean value of an expression, use this.
`;

export const stringOperatorDefinition = `
It's the plus sign **(+)**

And it's used to join two strings and give you back a single string.

So use this whenever you wanna join two or more strings.
`;

export const conditionalTernaryOperatorDefinition = `
It's used to test an expression.

And gives a different result depending on if the answer is true or false.

If the answer's true, it'll return the first value.

And, if it's false, it'll return the second.

So use this when you have different values for different results.
