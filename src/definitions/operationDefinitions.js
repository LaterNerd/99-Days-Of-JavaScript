export const expressionDefinition = `
I like to think about an expression as
a question that gives you an answer.

The question: *"what's the value?"*


#### For example:

- If you asked: 1 + 1? The code would ask, *"what's the value?"* 
and answer 2
- If you asked: 1 + 3? It would answer 4
- And, if you asked, 1? It would answer 1


The code's job is to answer the question 
*"what's the value?"* and return a single value.

It's the equal sign **(=)**

And it's how you set a variable to a value so you can keep track of it.

You can use it when you're first setting the value on a variable or when you need to update it.

So if you see an equal sign **(=)**, a variable's being set to a new value.

export const comparisonOperatorsDefinition = `
It's a way to compare two values.

And see whether something's true or false based on the comparison.

You can use it with a string, number, boolean, or object.

So use this when you need to compare if something's true or false.

#### 6 Types:
* Strict Equality: ===
* Strict Non Equality: !==
* Less than: <
* Greater than: >
* Less than or equal to: <=
* Greater than or equal to: >=

To do this, put whatever math you need to do first in parenthesis.
